# SmartMediaPlayer
A smart media player using opencv and image processing techniques. it's the perfect solution that aims to help you control your media player using hand gestures and face detection. It helps you to play, stop, raise up or lower down the volume and swipe right or left for the corresponding videos using hand gestures. also this tool will also detect if your eyes are shut (which means you fell asleep) and it pauses the video. <br />
